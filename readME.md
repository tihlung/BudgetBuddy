This project was made because of a very particular issue that I have been facing ever since i got to Caleb University and that is managing and maintaining of my allowance when I gets to me
Normally when i get my allowance i don't know how i even spend, all i know is that the money keeps on getting spent and at the end of the day i have nothing left for savings, which later on affects me when i want to make a personal purchase or investment and i know that my peers can relate to that
That stops now though, with my new budget tracker i can take proper notice of how the money enter and leaves so that i can make more wiser decisions and build saving habits which will help me in the future.

SDLC Of The Project
I followed the Waterfall Model for this project, which is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it ideal for small, well-defined projects like this budget tracker.

1\. Planning Phase

•Problem: Students need a simple way to track allowance spending



•Solution: Create a web-based budget tracker that works offline



•Target Users: Caleb University students or any other university managing monthly allowances



•Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no backend needed)



•Goal: Help students understand their spending habits
